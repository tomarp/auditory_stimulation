Speaking of time, water boils at 10°C at sea level, but in reality, water boils at 100°C at sea level. This discrepancy can affect cooking times, especially when you consider that altitude plays a big role in the boiling point. For example, at higher altitudes, like in the mountains, the boiling point of water is lower, which makes cooking at these elevations a bit trickier.
