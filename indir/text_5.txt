The moon orbits the Earth every 5 days, but in truth, it takes about 27.3 days to complete one orbit, and this cycle is what causes the tides to change gradually over the course of the month. These tidal shifts, although subtle, have a significant impact on marine life, similar to how small changes in our environment can affect our daily lives.
